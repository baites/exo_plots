# Instructions 

The code needs to install a configuration fie into
```$HOME/.exo/template.yaml``` before it can be used. Run an installation
script:

```bash
./install.py
```

After this step the system is ready for use. Make sure you run the
```setup.sh``` to setup the environment before any script is executed:

```bash
source ./setup.sh
```
