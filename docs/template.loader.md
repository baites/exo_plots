## [template.loader.py](https://github.com/ksamdev/exo_plots/blob/master/template/loader.py)

All histograms are kept in separate file per input, e.g. ttbar, wlight, wb,
zjets, data_spring_2011, data_summer_2011, etc.

```InputLoader``` will load into memory each input independently and read only
these histograms from file that are defined though arguments.

The ```ChannelLoader``` is responsible for loading the whole channel which
consists of at least one input, e.g.: load each input, process it and finally
merge inputs into channel.

## InputLoader

Load plots that are specified in patterns. The patterns is an array such that
each entry represents path inside ROOT file to plot to be loaded, e.g.:

```
/njets
/jet1/pt
```

The [BASH wildcards](http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/wildcards.html) are
accepted. For example, consider folder structure:

```
/jet1/pt
/jet1/eta
/jet2/pt
/jet2/eta
/jet3a/pt
/jet3a/eta
```

In this case, the below paths would be expanded to:

* ```/jet?/pt```
  load all jet1 and jet2 pT
* ```/jet*/eta```
  load all jets pT
* ```/jet[1-2]/pt```
  load jet1 and jet1 pt
* ```/jet[!1-2]/eta```
  load only jet3a eta
* ```/jet{1,3a}/eta```
  load jet1 and jet3a eta
* ```/jet1/*```
  load all jet properties

**WARNING**: _only 1D plots are loaded by default - extend the Loader for 2D
plots_

## ChannelLoader

Base loader for all the channels. It utilizes the InputLoader to load all
the inputs that go into the channel.
