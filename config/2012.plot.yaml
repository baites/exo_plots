# This [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2761803) configures
# the plot rebinning, title and units (that are automatically added to the
# axis title)
#
# WARNING: use unique names in name(s)

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# units is a dump dictionary that is removed from the config on load. It is
# only used as a reference in axis units and to reduce the file size
#
units:
    momentum_gev: &momentum_gev !!str "GeV/c"

    mass_tev: &mass_tev !!str "TeV/c^{2}"
    angle: &angle !!str "rad"
    distance: &distance !!str "cm"
# each plot is defined by its name, rebinning, range, units and title. All of
# the items are required. Prefix each entry with x and y in the 2D case.
